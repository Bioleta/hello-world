# hello-world
First repository that works as an introduction
I am not young. I have never done anything like computer-science or coding before. I would like to learn because I feel like an outsider when it comes to computers and technology. I expect to be bashing my head trying to understand concepts that are very simple for others. 
I welcome any feedback or criticism. Cheers.
